Question:
Write a query which return 5 persons who had spent most from a table and table contains customer id, 
product id and expenses. Customer id can be duplicate.

Answer: We need to create minHeap. The root will be the element with the lowest value.
Traverse all the values in all the three files, if we come across a value which is greater than the top of the Heap then
replace the top with this value.

Hence we use minHeap and not maxHeap.

To Remember:
When we need to find the top 5 lowest elements -> use minHeap
If a value is less than top then replace top
When we need to find the top 5 highest elements -> use minHeap
If a value is greater than top then replace the top
